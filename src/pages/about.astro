    Hi, I’m Raphael Gregorius, a Distinction Computer Science graduate with experience across iOS development, backend engineering, machine learning, and full-stack development. I’ve built production-ready apps and systems through roles at Apple Developer Academy, Paper.id, and Bangkit, working with technologies like Swift, Golang, Node.js, Unity, and Astro.

    Over the past few years, I’ve led technical teams, shipped real products, and collaborated across design, product, and engineering to deliver polished, user-focused solutions. My work ranges from iOS apps and IoT systems to 3D games and machine learning pipelines.
